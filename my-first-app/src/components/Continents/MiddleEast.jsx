            <h1>Middle Eastern Cuisines</h1>
            <p>
            While Middle Eastern food encompasses a variety of cuisines, it's generally 
            characterized by fragrant and copious spices, nuts, olive oil, and creamy elements. 
            Mutton, lamb, and goat are traditional meats. Chicken, camel, beef, fish, and pork are also used, but less frequently.

            Evidence of the earliest forms of plant domestication have been found in what we call the Fertile Crescent — an area that consists of modern-day 
            Syria, Lebanon, Northern Egypt, Israel and Southern Iraq.The location of the Middle East also contributes to the region’s rich culinary history. 
            At a geographic crossroad between Asia, Africa and Europe, the area served as the trading hub between empires on the famous Silk Road. 
            Along this route, diverse goods were traded, permanently transforming the cuisines of participating areas. 
            Deep flavored spices such as coriander, cinnamon, cassia, turmeric, saffron and garlic were popular and became building blocks of the regional cuisine.

            Middle Eastern food is all about fresh ingredients and adding plenty of vegetables in the dishes. Fried foods are rare in Middle Eastern cooking, which 
            instead uses baking, grilling, and raw ingredients. The great part about Middle Eastern cuisine is that it is easy and simple to prepare and doesn’t take 
            a lot of time. The focus is mainly about fresh ingredients such as purslane, parsley, mint, olive oil, rice, lentils, beans, onions, cucumbers, garlic, 
            tomatoes, pine nuts, a variety of spices, and cheese, butter and yoghurt and other dairy products.
