            <p>
                As a result of the colonization, the Caribbean is a fusion of multiple sources; British, Spanish, Dutch and French colonized the area and 
                brought their respective cuisines that mixed with West African as well as Amerindian, East Asian, Arab, South Asian influences from enslaved, 
                indentured and other laborers brought to work on the plantations.

                Ingredients that are common in most islands' dishes are rice, plantains, beans, cassava, cilantro, bell peppers, chickpeas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, coconut, and any of various meats that are locally available like beef, poultry, pork or fish. 
                Ingredients may include garlic, onions, scotch bonnet peppers, celery, green onions, and herbs like cilantro, Mexican mint, chives, marjoram, rosemary, tarragon and thyme. This green seasoning is used for a variety of dishes like curries, stews and roasted meats.
                <br />
                Traditional dishes are so important to regional culture that, for example, the local version of Caribbean goat stew has been chosen as the official national dish of Montserrat and is also one of the signature dishes of St. Kitts and Nevis. 
                <br />
                Over time, food from the Caribbean has evolved into a narrative technique through which their culture has been accentuated and promoted.
