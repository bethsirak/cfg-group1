            <h1>African Cuisines</h1>
            <p>The roots of African cusine goes back thousands of years to the bronze age in 
                NorthEast Africa, when early civilisations began cultivating grains, such as barley and wheat.
            </p>
            <h2>Central African cuisine</h2>
            <p>In Central Africa, a variety of crops are grown, including yams, cassava, bananas and plantains, sweet potatoes, and cocoyams. These crops have become staples in the 
                diet of many people in Central Africa. Central African cuisine has been influenced partly by Portuguese dishes. It has also been influenced but the cuising regions or East, West and Southern Africa. 
                This region has received culinary influence of the Swahilis (culture that evolved via the combination of Bantu, Yemeni, Omani and Indian cultures) during the trans-Saharan slave trade. Swahili culinary 
                influences can be found in dishes such as mandazi, pilaf rice, kachumbari, sambusa, and kuku paka.
            </p>
            <h2>East African cuisine</h2>
            <p>The cuisine of East Africa varies from area to area.<br/> 
                In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle-keeping peoples is distinctive meaning that meat products are generally absent. Cattle, sheep, 
                pigs and goats were regarded as a form of currency and a store of wealth. They are not generally consumed as food.
                <br/>
                In the Horn of Africa, the main traditional dishes in Eritrean cuisine and Ethiopian cuisine are tsebhis (stews) served with injera (flatbread made from teff, wheat, or sorghum) and hilbet (paste made from 
                legumes, mainly lentils and fava beans). Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries.
                <br/>
                In the lowlands, the main dish is akelet, a porridge-like dish made from wheat flour dough. A ladle is used to scoop out the top, which is filled with berbere and butter sauce and surrounded by milk or yoghurt. 
                A small piece of dough is broken and then used to scoop up the sauce.
                <br/>
                Food and nutrition security in East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan) is a significant issue. The region has been plagued by drought, conflict and economic instability since the 1990s. The current situation 
                is characterized by low levels of food availability and high levels of malnutrition among young children. 
            </p>
            <h2>North African cuisine</h2>
            <p>North African cuisine has been influenced over many centruies by traders, travellers, invaders, migrants and immingrants. The roots of North African cooking can be traced back to the ancient Empires of North Africa,
                particularly in Egypt. North African cuisine has been influenced by the introduction of spices such as saffron, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. 
                <br/>
                There are several similar dishes across some North African countries,sometimes, they may have a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different 
                nations, from the sophisticated, full-bodied flavors of Moroccan palace cookery to the fiery dishes of Tunisian cuisine and the humbler, simpler cuisines of Egypt and Algeria.
            </p>
            <h2>Southern African cuisine</h2>
            <p>
            The cooking of the region of Southern Africa is sometimes called "rainbow cuisine", as the food of the region is a blend of many cultures: Indiginous African, European and Asian.
            The indigenous Africans of Southern Africa were roughly divided into two groups and several subgroups. The largest group consisted of the Bantu-speakersThe largest group consisted of the Bantu-speakers.
            The Bantu-speakers grew grain crops extensively and raised cattle, sheep and goats. They also grew and continue to grow pumpkins, beans, and leafy greens as vegetables. they primarily ate dishes consisting of grain, meat, milk and vegetables.
            A smaller group were the primeval residents of the region, the Khoisan, who some archaeologists believe had lived in the region for at least 10,000 years. The Khosian were originally hunter-gatherers. Some started to raise cattle. Their 
            dishes consisted of roasted meat from wild animals, which they also dried for later use and wild tubers and vegetables.
            <br/>
            The influence of this diet is reflected in Southern African love of Braai(barbecue) and bitlong(dried preserved meat).
            </p>
            <h2>West Afican cuisine</h2>
            <p>
                A typical West African meal is made with starchy items and can contain meat, fish as well as various spices and herbs. The staple grain or starch varies between regions and ethnic groups, although corn has gained significant ground as it is 
                cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Rice dishes are also widely eaten in the region.
                <br/>
                The local cuisine and recipes of West Africa continue to remain deeply entrenched in the local customs and traditions, with ingredients like native rice (Oryza glaberrima), rice, fonio, millet, sorghum, Bambara groundnuts and Hausa groundnuts, 
                black-eyed peas, brown beans, and root vegetables such as yams, cocoyams, sweet potatoes, and cassava. Cooking techniques include roasting, baking, boiling, frying, mashing, and spicing. A range of sweets and savories are also prepared.
